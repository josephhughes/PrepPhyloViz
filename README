SNPfilePrep.pl by Joseph Hughes, University of Glasgow

This is a perl script for preparing the input files for Phyloviz. It 
creates the isolate data file and the SNP dataset from an alignement 
in fasta format. It expects the fasta file ids to be in the form of 
a number or word followed by D by a number by S by a number (pig123D4S1, 
i.e. the host, the day of the sampling and the sequence number)

This script uses Bioperl modules.
